## üßê About Random Happy Face</a>
The purpose of this bot is rather simple as to entertain your Twitter feed by sending out a simple smiley face made of emojis that will contain two randomly selected emojis that will be used for the eyes and mouth. 

This bot is set up to tweet at 12 PM every day. This bot will hopefully soon be developed to allow for this bot to be able to tweet multiple times of the day at random times of the day. 
![About](https://i.gifer.com/B4IU.gif)

## üí≠ How it works</a>

This bot first creates a string using a template that will create a smiley face using a dictionary of every emoji with the name and the unicodes for it in the file unicode_codes.py which will be converted into a list to allow randomization of selection. 

If the tweet string longer than 280 characters, which is the character limit of Twitter, it will loop recursively until it will get a tweet that is less than 280 characters. 

The bot will then use Tweepy API (A Twitter API for Python) to send the tweet using one of its methods. 

The entire bot is written in Python 3.7

## üéà Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

To use the bot, type into the bash console:
```bash
python main.py 
```

The bot will output this: 
```python
# meaning the tweet execution was successful 
"Execution Complete: No Errors"  
```
or this: 
```python 
# in the brackets, the error found will be put in as a string 
"Here's the problem: {}"
```

### Example:

> python main.py

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
